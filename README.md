# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

When I thought of coding as a career, I was scared as the coding jargon which was very overwhelming. But once I started to read about the various terms by going to my township library, I developed an interest in coding. This webpage was developed to help people who are contemplating to take up coding as a career. The use of this webpage will enable them to overcome their fears as most of the content they will find here will be non technical and easy to understand. I hope by visiting this webpage people like me who were scared to take up coding as a career are encourged and will make coding a career choice.
